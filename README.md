# DM-CAPTURE-GENERAL-MEDIATOR
Dark matter capture in celestial bodies for interactions mediated by arbitrary mass mediators
DM capture in celestial bodies is a novel astrophysical probe of DM interactions. We provided a general treatment of DM capture rate in compact stellar objects to account for arbitrary mediator masses, and revisited the astrophysical exclusions on DM-nucleon scattering cross section from DM accretion in compact stars. We concluded that the astrophysical exclusions drastically weaken for light mediators, and can even be completely voided for light enough mediators.
