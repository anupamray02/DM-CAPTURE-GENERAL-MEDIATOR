# DM-CAPTURE-GENERAL-MEDIATOR
Dark matter capture in compact celestial bodies for interactions mediated by arbitrary mass mediators

DM capture in celestial bodies is a novel astrophysical probe of DM interactions. We provided a general treatment for DM capture rate in compact stellar objects to account for arbitrary mediator masses, and revisited the astrophysical exclusions on DM-nucleon scattering cross section from eletromagnetic obserbations of old & cold neutron stars. We concluded that the astrophysical exclusions drastically weaken for light mediators, and can even be completely voided for light enough mediators.
