# DM-CAPTURE-GENERAL-MEDIATOR
Dark Matter capture in compact celestial bodies for interactions mediated by arbitrary mass mediators

DM capture in celestial bodies is a novel astrophysical probe of DM interactions. We provided a general treatment for DM capture rate in compact stellar objects to account for arbitrary mediator masses, and revisited the astrophysical exclusions on DM-nucleon scattering cross-section from electromagnetic observations of old & cold neutron stars. We concluded that the astrophysical exclusions drastically weaken for light mediators, and can even be completely alleviated for interactions mediated by very light mediators. Furthermore, we showed the impact of repulsive self-interactions among the DM particles on the capture rate, and derived constraints on DM self-interaction strength from the existence of old neutron stars, complementary to the constraints obtained from the merging galaxy clusters.
